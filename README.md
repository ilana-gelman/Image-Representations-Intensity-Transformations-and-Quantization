# Image-Representations-Intensity-Transformations-and-Quantization
Image Processing – Exercise 1

This exercise covers:
• Loading grayscale and RGB image representations.
• Displaying figures and images.
• Transforming RGB color images back and forth from the YIQ color space.
• Performing intensity transformations: histogram equalization.
• Performing optimal quantization
